# Notes

This folder contains **static exploration documents** - planning, design exploration, and thinking-out-loud documents that are frozen in time.

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-<topic>.md` for dated notes, e.g.:
- `2025-01-oompa_loompa_exploration.md`
- `2025-01-myth_of_long_running_tasks.md`

## What Belongs Here

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Design Explorations | Comparing approaches, weighing trade-offs |
| Planning Documents | Initial designs, roadmaps at a point in time |
| Blog Posts / Essays | Polished writing meant to be shared |
| Decision Records | Why we chose X over Y |
| Research Notes | What we learned investigating a topic |

## What Does NOT Belong Here

Living documentation belongs in `docs/`:
- API references (change with the code)
- Configuration guides (update when options change)
- Getting started guides (update as setup evolves)
