## Agent Role Rules

- Read only task-relevant files first; do not dump the whole repo.
- If a task is underspecified, state missing assumptions and identify which files are needed next.
- Stay within your assigned role and task scope unless a clear blocker requires broader changes.
- Keep changes focused and explain only what is needed to finish the current task.
